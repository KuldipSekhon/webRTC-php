webRTC PHP + JS 0.2
===============

This was me trying to get webRTC and PHP working together without relying on websockets.

The chat is fully functional on Firefox Nightly 24.0a1

Chrome does not yet fully support the dataChannel.

Installation
===========
1. Create table chats (You can use the scheme.sql provided);

2. Fill up the config.php with the necessary data.

3. Open up the index.php webpage in any Nightly build of Firefox;

4. Open up the given session link on another computer to start your communication.

5. PROFIT!
